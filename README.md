How to use flask_platform:

1. First, install the systeminfocookie package from GitHub using the following command at the command line. 
    
    pip install git+https://github.com/SheenaDub/systeminfocookie
    
Flask_platform will not work if you do not have this installed.

2. Then clone flask_platform to your desired directory by typing the following into the command line:
    
    git clone https://github.com/SheenaDub/flask_platform
    
3. Then navigate into the flask_platform directory using the command 'cd flask_platform'

4 Then run the run.py file from the command line using the following command:

    python run.py
    
5. The flask window showing your system information should now appear in a web browser, if you navigate to the local host address (the number should appear in the command line)
